At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/ReutersScholz dashed hopes that he would announce a decision to supply Ukraine with heavy tanks in his keynote speech in Davos earlier in the day, making no new weapon commitments and warning the world needed to avoid escalating the conflict into a war between Russia and Nato.Instead, Scholz ran through a list of the military hardware Germany was supplying and stressed his country’s determination to ensure Ukraine triumphed.But speaking hours after a helicopter crash near a suburb of Kyiv that killed 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine cannot afford to wait for Russia to regroup. He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.

At least 14 people, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials have been killed after a helicopter crashed near a nursery in a suburb of Kyiv. A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualties after debris hit the building. The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggested one child had been killed, after previous reports that the number was at least three.
Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was investigating possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.
Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister. The victims of the crash include Monastyrsky’s first deputy, Yevhen Yenin, the state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Yuri Lubkovych, their assistants and the helicopter crew.

Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts.
Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine was “inevitable”. Putin announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. In a separate speech, the Russian leader also claimed Moscow’s actions in Ukraine were intended to stop a “war” that had been raging in eastern Ukraine for many years. Ukraine and the west have rejected Putin’s stated objectives of demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine as a pretext for a war of choice and unprovoked aggression.
Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country, one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow, provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies in the face of resistance from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy” as Germany hesitated over whether to supply the country with Leopard 2 tanks.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Ukraine needed a “significant increase” in weapons in order to reach a “negotiated peaceful solution”. He was cautious on whether Germany would lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve their transfer, saying consultations were ongoing. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, warned that the military alliance must be prepared “for the long haul” and support Ukraine for as long as it took.
Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at the Davos summit, although he held the door open to a positive decision at a special summit of western defence ministers on Friday. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks at all when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export, prompting an apparently frustrated Ukrainian president to warn the same forum against delay.
Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, adding that current levels of assistance were inadequate.
Canada has announced that it will donate 200 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”.
Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report. People began placing flowers at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka in a “spontaneous memorial in memory of the victims of the missile strike in Dnipro”, the independent Russian human rights monitor OVD-Info said.

He said:
The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revenge the world needs resolve and speed. The supply of Ukraine with air defence systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supply of western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks.
The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attacks on security and peace in other countries.
